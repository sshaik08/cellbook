         <h2>Control of the Cell</h2>
         <p>City hall represents the nucleus, which is the control center of the cell. It is an essential organelle that is held by all
            eukaryotic cells. It is a spherical/ellipsodial structure, with four specific organelles that are part of it:</p>
         <h3>1) Nucleus</h3>
         <p>The nucleus, aka city hall, is the centrally commanding office of the city. It makes all the decisions and controls everything related to the cell. The next four organelles are part of the nucleus.</p>
         <h3 style="color: #CC412F">2) Nuclear Membrane</h3>
         <p>Represented by the security gate around city hall, the nuclear membrane fully surrounds the nucleus to protect it and regulate what enters and leaves the nucleus. It is a lipid bilayer covered with nuclear pores.</p>
         <h3 style="color: #33A33C">3) Nuclear Pores</h3>
         <p>They are like the security checkpoints in the security gate. They are protein-lined openings in the nuclear membrane that directly allow or prevent things coming in/out of th nucleus. For example, this is where the ribosomes produced in the nucleolus can exit the nucleus to the rest of the cell</p>
         <h3 style="color: #A3005A">4) Chromosomes</h3>
         <p> These can be thought as the libraries storing records in city hall, that have all the information, policies, etc. of the city. Similarly, the chromosomes are thread-like structures primarily composed of DNA, which carries genetic information about the cell.</p>
         <h3 style="background-color: #F5F37F">5) Nucleolus</h3>
         <p>The nucleolus can be thought of as the headquarters for the city's construction company. This dense, round structure produces ribosomes, which is an essential part of protein synthesis, a function required for all kinds of cells.</p>
