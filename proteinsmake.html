         <h2>Making Proteins</h2>
         <p>The general structure is called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but it has three parts, two of which are responsible for synthesizing proteins for the cell. They are involved in the production and processing of proteins. The endoplasmic reticulum is located near the nucleus.</p>
         <h3 style="color: #cc8e31">6) Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)</h3>
         <p>The rough ER can be thought of as a factory assembly line. It sends proteins through structural modifications and then they are transported outside the cell OR incorporated into cellular membranes and phopholipids. It is a network of flat tubes, covered in studs, and is directly attached to the nuclear membrane.</p>
         <h3 style="color: #cc3181">7) Ribosomes</h3>
         <p>The rough ER is called rough because of the tiny dots that cover it. These are ribosomes, that are like the assembly line works in the rough ER that work to faciliate protein synthesis. Ribosomes can also exist on their own in cytoplasm. </p>
         <h3 style="color: #f58d7b">8) Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum</h3>
         <p>Unlike the rough ER, the smooth ER isn't lined with ribosomes. Imagine a chemical plant, that has to process and anufacture essential products, clean up harmful substances, and store materials for future use. The smooth ER synthesises macromolecules such as carbohydrates, lipids, and steroid hormones. In addition, it detoxifies medicines and poison, as well as stores calcium ions While it doesn't handle proteins like the rough ER with its ribosomes, it still plays an essential part in synthesizing other macromolecules which are used in important biological processes. It looks similar to the rough ER but without the studded ribosomes making it look smoother. </p>
