         <h2>Movement and Structure</h2>
         <p>These are the organelles that allow the cell to shape itself, move around the organism, and organize internal parts.</p>
         <h3 style="color: #CC3181">13) Flagella</h3>
         <p>This is a single (or a few) long, string-like structure(s) that can be compared to the city's transport system. It allows cells to move around in an organism. This is not present in all animal cells.</p>
         <h3 style="color: #8C1DCC">14) Cillia</h3>
         <p>These are many short, string-like structures that line the outside of the cell membrane. They are more like street sweepers because, in addition to assisting with cell transportation, the cillia also helps particles move across the outer surface of the cell and filters out materials. It is also not present in all animal cells.</p>
         <h3 style="color: #CCAC39">15) Cytoskeleton</h3>
         <p>Represented by roads and city infrastructure, the cytoskeleton is a network of protein parts that give the cell  structure and facilitate movement across the cell. It secures organelles in place but allows vesicles (transport) to move within the cell.</p>
