         <h2>Energy and Waste</h2>
         <p>These following structures are the cell's centers for energy generation, recycling, and waste breakdown.</p>
         <h3 style="background-color: #a1ebff">11) Lysosome</h3>
         <p>This organelle appears to be very similar to a vesicle from the outside. However, it can be thought of as a waste management and recycling organization. The enzymes in the lysosome digest large molecules and break them down. They will also digest broken organelles to clean up the cell.</p>
         <h3 style="color: #cc712c; background-color: #ffdeb8">12) Mitochondria</h3>
         <p>Often refered to as "the powerhouse of the cell", the mitochondria is an oval-shaped organelle with two membranes, the inner being folded into itself. It's purpose is generating energy for the cell to use, like the power plant of a city. It makes energy by converting sugar and oxygen into ATP, the source of energy for organisms. The sugar and oxygen comes from the materials broken down by the lysosome. </p>
